# Impacts on Society

Introduction to Computer Science: This course will be available to 9th grade students as an elective course. It has been a difficult number of years for Paradise Unified School District, starting with the Camp Fire devastation and continuing with the Covid 19 pandemic before adequate recovery could take place. There have not been many opportunities for diversification in courses and the emphasis has been on educational basics. 

This course will serve as an introduction to computer science concepts and beginning coding. No prerequisites or prior knowledge will be required. For many students, this will be their first dedicated course in computer science.  There will be a responsibility to fully introduce a background that educates the students not only on the understanding and application of processes but on the ethics of the discipline and the impacts upon society - with an emphasis on curriculum that encourages diversity, equity, and inclusion. The coursework will reflect a dedication to doing so along with continued reflection and adaption as I evaluate the effectiveness of the instruction. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Formative assessment will be ongoing.  The emphasis is on learning and growing rather than summative assessment.  I will adapt and formulate my rubric according to the model set by SFUSD at https://sites.google.com/sfusd.edu/csplc/resources/teaching-rubric.  This rubric focuses not just on performing tasks - rather, it allows teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching practices at the same time and make adjustments as needed.  The goal of assessments is to identify need and ensure student understanding. If students are not able to master concepts, it will be incumbent upon me to adapt and enhance instruction. Students will be given additional opportunities to meet objectives with reteaching. 

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
