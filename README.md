# Impacts on Society

Introduction to Computer Science: This course will be available to middle school or 9th grade students as an elective course. It has been a difficult number of years for Paradise Unified School District, starting with the Camp Fire devastation and continuing with the Covid 19 pandemic before adequate recovery could take place. There have not been many opportunities for diversification in courses and the emphasis has been on educational basics. 

This course will serve as an introduction to computer science concepts using Project Stem's CS Explorations 2: Artificial Intelligence as the course backdrop. Mapped to CTSA Standards, no prerequisites or prior knowledge will be required. For many students, this will be their first dedicated course in computer science.  There will be a responsibility to fully introduce a background that educates the students not only on the understanding and application of processes but on the ethics of the discipline and the impacts upon society - with an emphasis on curriculum that encourages diversity, equity, and inclusion. The coursework will reflect a dedication to doing so along with continued reflection and adaption as I evaluate the effectiveness of the instruction. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

CS Explorations 2: Artificial Intelligence
> This course provides students with an introduction to artificial intelligence, designed around engaging activities and lessons that integrate CS and computational thinking concepts with ethical design and responsible use, as students explore how these technologies can help solve problems and improve life for themselves and their communities.

Block A: Getting Started With Artificial Intelligence
Knowledge comprehension application analysis synthesis evaluation

Block B: Representation, Reasoning, and Machine Learning
Knowledge comprehension application analysis synthesis evaluation

Block C: Generative AI and Applied AI
Knowledge comprehension application analysis synthesis evaluation

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Formative assessment will be ongoing.  The emphasis is on learning and growing rather than summative assessment.  I will adapt and formulate my rubric according to the model set by SFUSD at https://sites.google.com/sfusd.edu/csplc/resources/teaching-rubric.  This rubric focuses not just on performing tasks - rather, it allows teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching practices at the same time and make adjustments as needed.  The goal of assessments is to identify need and ensure student understanding. If students are not able to master concepts, it will be incumbent upon me to adapt and enhance instruction. Students will be given additional opportunities to meet objectives with reteaching. 

### Outcomes

The course will initially be showcased in the school's Elective Fair to be sure that all students become familiar with the availability of the course and what it consists of.  I will coordinate with the student broadcast to have the course covered in announcements.  We can discuss in LCAP how to disseminate information and  liason with site council on fund availability for the program. Much like Leadership programs, students will not be required to have a minimum GPA to add the course.

Since this is an introductory course, a desired outcome would be to generate an interest in computer science in students who had not previously had access to the content through education.  It would serve as an access course to future computer science classes and provide a basic understanding of computer science and the ethics involved,opening avenues of study not previously available in an inclusionary process that makes students feel connected and capable.
