# Impacts on Society

Introduction to Computer Science: This course is available to 9th grade students as an elective course. It has been a difficult number of years for Paradise Unified School District, starting with the Camp Fire devastation and continuing with the Covid 19 pandemic before adequate recovery could take place. There have not been many opportunities for diversification in courses and the emphasis has been on educational basics. This course will serve as an introduction to computer science concepts and beginning coding. No prerequisites or prior knowledge will be required. For many students, this will be their first dedicated course in computer science.  There will be a responsibility to fully introduce a background that educates the students not only on the understanding and application of processes but on the ethics of the discipline and the impacts upon society - with an emphasis on curriculum that encourages diversity, equity, and inclusion. The coursework will reflect a dedication to doing so along with continued reflection and adaption as I evaluate the effectiveness of the instruction.
