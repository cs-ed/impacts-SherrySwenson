# Impacts on Society

Introduction to Computer Science: This course will be available to middle school or 9th grade students as an elective course. It has been a difficult number of years for Paradise Unified School District, starting with the Camp Fire devastation and continuing with the Covid 19 pandemic before adequate recovery could take place. There have not been many opportunities for diversification in courses and the emphasis has been on educational basics. 

This course will serve as an introduction to computer science concepts using Project Stem's CS Explorations 2: Artificial Intelligence as the course backdrop. Mapped to CTSA Standards, no prerequisites or prior knowledge will be required. For many students, this will be their first dedicated course in computer science.  There will be a responsibility to fully introduce a background that educates the students not only on the understanding and application of processes but on the ethics of the discipline and the impacts upon society - with an emphasis on curriculum that encourages diversity, equity, and inclusion. The coursework will reflect a dedication to doing so along with continued reflection and adaption as I evaluate the effectiveness of the instruction. 
### Plan

### Learning Objectives

CS Explorations 2: Artificial Intelligence - This curriculum was chosen because of its focus on social implications. According to Project Stem:
> This course provides students with an introduction to artificial intelligence, designed around engaging activities and lessons that integrate CS and computational thinking concepts with ethical design and responsible use, as students explore how these technologies can help solve problems and improve life for themselves and their communities.

1. Block A: Getting Started With Artificial Intelligence

2. Block B: Representation, Reasoning, and Machine Learning

3. Block C: Generative AI and Applied AI

Remember/Understand/ApplyA/nalyze/Evaluate/Create
- Students start exploring what artificial intelligence is and how it is defined. 
- Students will begin with an overview of topics including the definition of intelligence, the key principles that will be covered in this course, and how to use Scratch.
- Students are introduced to artificial intelligence in more detail as they examine four fields that rely on AI technology every day: robotics, entertainment, social media, and chatbots.
- Students will continue to build a strong understanding of artificial intelligence and the technology that it is used to create.
- Students will apply what they've learned about artificial intelligence to create a unique, creative program in Scratch.
- Students will explore representations of data structures and how AI technology uses representations and reasoning to make decisions. 
- Students will look at various ways that data can be represented, whether by looking at data represented hierarchically in a decision tree, locations represented in a coordinate graph, or the representation of words and natural language. 
- Students will explore machine learning, a hot topic in AI.
- Students will see that supervised machine learning can be used to create classification models, examine how the size, completeness, and diversity of a dataset affects the performance of a machine learning algorithm, and see that machine learning algorithms may extract features that may be different from the conceptual features that humans find valuable or informative.
- Students will apply what they've learned about artificial intelligence to create a unique, creative program in Scratch.
- Students will explore types of Generative AI technology, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). They will play a discriminator game to see how GANs work, and learn to use some of the tools that help model how AI technology works.
- Students will also dig into the social implications of generative AI, including deepfakes and style transfer, all while discussing the real world impact of AI technology.
- Students will explore the big idea that intelligent agents require many kinds of knowledge to interact naturally with humans. 
- Students will look deeper at how AI technology mimics natural language and common sense reasoning in order to appear more natural and lifelike. Topics include chatbots, data collection and privacy, and a debate about the future of society as AI technology continues to advance at a faster and faster pace.
- Students will apply what they've learned about artificial intelligence to create a unique, creative program in Scratch.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Formative assessment will be ongoing.  The emphasis is on learning and growing rather than summative assessment.  I will adapt and formulate my rubric according to the model set by [SFUSD](https://sites.google.com/sfusd.edu/csplc/resources/teaching-rubric).  This rubric focuses not just on performing tasks - rather, it allows teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching practices at the same time and make adjustments as needed.  The goal of assessments is to identify need and ensure student understanding. If students are not able to master concepts, it will be incumbent upon me to adapt and enhance instruction. Students will be given additional opportunities to meet objectives with reteaching. 

### Outcomes

The course will initially be showcased in the school's Elective Fair to be sure that all students become familiar with the availability of the course and what it consists of.  I will coordinate with the student broadcast to have the course covered in announcements.  We can discuss in LCAP how to disseminate information and  liason with site council on fund availability for the program. Much like Leadership programs, students will not be required to have a minimum GPA to add the course.

Since this is an introductory course, a desired outcome would be to generate an interest in computer science in students who had not previously had access to the content through education.  It would serve as an access course to future computer science classes and provide a basic understanding of computer science and the ethics involved,opening avenues of study not previously available in an inclusionary process that makes students feel connected and capable.
